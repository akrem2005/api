    <h1>Understanding the Foreign Exchange Market</h1>

    <p>
      Welcome to our tutorial on the basics of the foreign exchange (forex)
      market. In this guide, we'll provide you with a step-by-step overview,
      explaining essential terms such as currency pairs, pip, and leverage.
      Understanding these concepts is crucial for beginners entering the world
      of forex trading.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 1: What is the Forex Market?</h2>

    <p>
      The forex market is the global marketplace for trading currencies. It
      operates 24 hours a day, five days a week, and involves the buying and
      selling of currency pairs. These pairs consist of a base currency and a
      quote currency.

    <h2>Step 2: Currency Pairs</h2>

    <p>
      A currency pair is the quoting of one currency against another. The first
      currency is the base currency, and the second is the quote currency. For
      example, in the pair EUR/USD, the euro is the base currency, and the US
      dollar is the quote currency.

    <h2>Step 3: Pip (Percentage in Point)</h2>

    <p>
      A pip is a standardized unit of movement in the exchange rate. It
      represents the smallest price move that a given exchange rate can make
      based on market convention. Most currency pairs are quoted to four decimal
      places, and one pip is typically the last decimal point.

    <h2>Step 4: Leverage</h2>

    <p>
      Leverage allows traders to control a larger position size with a
      relatively small amount of capital. While it can magnify profits, it also
      increases the risk of significant losses. Understanding how leverage works
      is crucial for effective risk management in forex trading.

    <h2>Step 5: Importance for Beginners</h2>

    <p>
      For beginners, understanding the forex market is essential before engaging
      in trading. It helps in making informed decisions, managing risks, and
      developing effective trading strategies. Always start with a solid
      foundation of knowledge to increase your chances of success in the forex
      market.
