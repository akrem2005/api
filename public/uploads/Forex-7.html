    <h1>Importance of Risk Management in Forex Trading</h1>

    <p>
      Welcome to our tutorial on the crucial topic of risk management in forex
      trading. Understanding and implementing effective risk management
      strategies are key to preserving capital and achieving long-term success
      in the forex market.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 1: The Importance of Risk Management</h2>

    <p>
      Risk management is essential in forex trading to protect your capital from
      substantial losses. By defining and adhering to risk parameters, traders
      can minimize the impact of market volatility and unpredictable events,
      ensuring a more sustainable and secure trading experience.

    <h2>Step 2: Setting Stop-Loss and Take-Profit Orders</h2>

    <p>
      Setting stop-loss orders helps limit potential losses by automatically
      closing a trade at a predetermined price level. Take-profit orders, on the
      other hand, lock in profits by closing a trade when a specific profit
      target is reached. Implementing these orders is crucial for disciplined
      trading and risk mitigation.

    <h2>Step 3: Determining Position Size Based on Risk Tolerance</h2>

    <p>
      Determining the appropriate position size based on your risk tolerance is
      a fundamental aspect of risk management. This involves calculating the
      maximum amount of capital at risk per trade, considering factors such as
      account size, risk percentage per trade, and the distance to the stop-loss
      level.
