    <h1>Understanding Currency Pairs in Forex Trading</h1>

    <p>
      Welcome to our tutorial on major, minor, and exotic currency pairs, how to
      read them, and an overview of popular currency pairs in the forex market.
      This guide will provide you with the necessary knowledge to navigate the
      intricacies of currency trading.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 1: Major, Minor, and Exotic Currency Pairs</h2>

    <p>
      Currency pairs are categorized into major, minor, and exotic. Major pairs
      involve the most traded currencies globally, minors include currencies
      from smaller economies, and exotics consist of one major currency and one
      from a developing or small economy.

    <h2>Step 2: How to Read a Currency Pair</h2>

    <p>
      A currency pair is displayed in a format such as EUR/USD, where the first
      currency (EUR) is the base currency, and the second (USD) is the quote
      currency. The exchange rate indicates how much of the quote currency is
      needed to purchase one unit of the base currency.
