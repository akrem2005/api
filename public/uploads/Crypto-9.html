    <h1>Understanding ICOs, Tokens, and Altcoins</h1>

    <p>
      Welcome to our tutorial on Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), tokens, and
      alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins). In this guide, we'll explore the
      concepts of ICOs, the differences between cryptocurrencies and tokens, and
      the various use cases and features of altcoins.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 1: Understanding Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and Token Sales</h2>

    <p>
      ICOs are fundraising events where new projects sell their underlying
      crypto tokens to early investors. Investors participate by purchasing
      these tokens, often with the expectation that the value will increase as
      the project develops. Token sales provide a means for projects to raise
      funds for development and users to gain early access to project tokens.

    <h2>Step 2: Differentiating Between Cryptocurrencies and Tokens</h2>

    <p>
      Cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, operate on their own
      blockchain and serve as a medium of exchange. Tokens, on the other hand,
      represent assets or utilities and are typically built on existing
      blockchain platforms. Understanding this distinction is crucial for
      navigating the diverse landscape of blockchain-based assets.

      Step 3: Exploring Alternative Cryptocurrencies (Altcoins) and Their Use
      Cases
    </h2>

    <p>
      Altcoins refer to alternative cryptocurrencies to Bitcoin. They often
      present unique features, use cases, and technologies. Explore various
      altcoins such as Litecoin, Ripple, and Cardano, each designed to address
      specific challenges or provide different functionalities within the
      blockchain ecosystem.
