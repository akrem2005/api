    <h1>Overview of Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain Technology</h1>

    <p>
      Welcome to our tutorial on cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. In
      this guide, we'll provide an overview of what cryptocurrencies are, how
      they work, explain blockchain technology, and introduce popular
      cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.
    </p>

    <h2>Understanding Cryptocurrencies</h2>

    <p>
      Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies that use cryptography
      for security and operate on a decentralized network called blockchain.
      Unlike traditional currencies, cryptocurrencies are not controlled by any
      central authority like a government or financial institution.

    <h2>Explaining Blockchain Technology</h2>

    <p>
      Blockchain is the underlying technology behind cryptocurrencies. It is a
      decentralized and distributed ledger that records transactions across a
      network of computers. Each block in the chain contains a list of
      transactions, and once a block is completed, it is linked to the previous
      block, creating a secure and unchangeable record of all transactions.
    </p>

    <h2>Introduction to Popular Cryptocurrencies</h2>

    <p>
      Two of the most well-known cryptocurrencies are Bitcoin and Ethereum.
      Bitcoin, created in 2009, is often referred to as digital gold and is used
      as a store of value and a medium of exchange. Ethereum, launched in 2015,
      introduced smart contracts, enabling the creation of decentralized
      applications on its platform.
