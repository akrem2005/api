    <h1>Dropshipping Basics</h1>

    <p>
      Welcome to our tutorial on dropshipping, an innovative retail model that
      has gained popularity in recent years. In this guide, we'll explore the
      definition and concept of dropshipping, how it differs from traditional
      retail models, and the advantages and disadvantages it presents for
      beginners.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 1: Definition and Concept of Dropshipping</h2>

    <p>
      Dropshipping is a retail fulfillment method where a store doesn't keep the
      products it sells in stock. Instead, when a store sells a product, it
      purchases the item from a third party and has it shipped directly to the
      customer. This means the merchant never sees or handles the product.

    <h2>Step 2: How Dropshipping Differs from Traditional Retail Models</h2>

    <p>
      Dropshipping differs from traditional retail models in that it eliminates
      the need for the seller to stock or own inventory. Traditional retailers
      purchase and stock inventory upfront, while dropshippers only purchase
      products as they are sold. This reduces the financial risks and
      operational complexities associated with inventory management.

    <h2>Step 3: Advantages and Disadvantages of Dropshipping for Beginners</h2>

    <p>
      For beginners, dropshipping offers advantages such as lower startup costs,
      a wide product selection, and flexibility. However, challenges include
      lower profit margins, reliance on suppliers, and potential shipping and
      quality control issues. Understanding these pros and cons is essential for
      those considering entering the dropshipping business.
