    <h1>Introduction to Technical Analysis in Forex Trading</h1>

    <p>
      Welcome to our tutorial on technical analysis, focusing on candlestick
      charts, trendlines, key technical indicators, and tips for analyzing price
      charts. Understanding these concepts will empower you to make more
      informed trading decisions.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 1: Candlestick Charts and Trendlines</h2>

    <p>
      Candlestick charts provide a visual representation of price movements.
      Each candlestick shows the opening, closing, high, and low prices for a
      specific period. Trendlines, drawn by connecting highs or lows, help
      identify trends and potential reversal points in the market.

    <h2>Step 2: Key Technical Indicators for Beginners</h2>

    <p>
      For beginners, important technical indicators include moving averages,
      which smooth out price data to identify trends, and the Relative Strength
      Index (RSI), which measures the speed and change of price movements.
      Understanding these indicators can help you make more informed trading
      decisions.

      potential reversal points. Additionally, pay attention to chart patterns
      and support/resistance levels for a comprehensive analysis.
