    <h1>Introduction to Cryptocurrency Exchanges and Trading Basics</h1>

    <p>
      Welcome to our tutorial on cryptocurrency exchanges and trading
      fundamentals. In this guide, we'll cover the basics of cryptocurrency
      trading, including exchanges, trading pairs, order types, and
      understanding price charts.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 1: Cryptocurrency Exchanges and Trading Pairs</h2>

    <p>
      Cryptocurrency exchanges are online platforms that facilitate the buying,
      selling, and trading of various cryptocurrencies. Trading pairs represent
      the currencies being traded against each other. For example, in the pair
      BTC/USD, BTC is the base currency, and USD is the quote currency.

    <h2>Step 2: Basics of Market Orders, Limit Orders, and Stop Orders</h2>

    <p>
      Understanding different order types is crucial for effective trading.
      Market orders are executed immediately at the current market price. Limit
      orders allow traders to set a specific price at which they want to buy or
      sell. Stop orders help manage risk by triggering a market order when the
      price reaches a specified level.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Step 3: Reading Cryptocurrency Price Charts and Candlestick Patterns
    </h2>

    <p>
      Cryptocurrency price charts display historical price movements.
      Candlestick patterns provide insights into market sentiment. Each
      candlestick represents a specific time period and includes open, close,
      high, and low prices. Patterns like bullish/bearish engulfing and doji can
      help predict future price movements.
