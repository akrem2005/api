    <h1>Exploring Demo Trading Accounts</h1>

    <p>
      Welcome to our tutorial on demo trading accounts, the importance of

      backtesting to evaluate the effectiveness of your trading plan. Utilizing
      these tools is essential for honing your skills and improving your trading
      performance.

      A demo trading account is a risk-free simulation of live trading, allowing
      you to practice trading strategies with virtual money. It provides a
      realistic market environment where you can execute trades, test
      strategies, and familiarize yourself with the trading platform without
      risking your capital.

    <h2>Step 3: How to Use Backtesting</h2>

    <p>
      Backtesting involves testing your trading strategy against historical
      market data to evaluate its performance. By analyzing past results, you
      can identify strengths and weaknesses in your plan, optimize parameters,
      and make informed adjustments. Backtesting helps you understand how your
      strategy would have performed in different market conditions.
